And out they walked in single file
And through the door i saw you smile
And i, i was the only one to know

They tied a rag across my eyes
A silver spoon to feed me lies
And you, you were the only one to know.

So find your monster don't tell your friends
And write your name on the back of the page just to try
Pull the flowers but keep your hands clean
Leave the earth in a jar but come back to it
