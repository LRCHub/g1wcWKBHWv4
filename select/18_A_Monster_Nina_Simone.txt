What's as big as a mountain
And grows bigger every day
'Til it's taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers
Into hurt and lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing
Tearing love like I was a part
How could you believe I wasn't true
When I love with all my heart

Darling, what a silly rumor
Come through lying lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What's as big as a mountain
And grows bigger every day
'Till it's taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers
Into hurtin' lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing
Tearin' love like I was a part
How could you believe I wasn't true
When I love you with all my heart

Darling, one silly rumor
Turning fun through lying lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
