There is something very dark
The shadow of which can't be turned around
To diffuse some light, what is this thing at last
Whose sound has been muted and repressed?
Attracted to the color red

Some dim
Some intimately deep corner

You're not much loved
Under the light

One war
Was one too many war
One war
The one that killed his soul

He runs closer and closer
To the wood, for your love
And although well and in flux
He teaches no one

Chance crushes
The deeper bones

So what, you are a monster
But I'm part woman

Rid yourself of me

Your case needs opening up
Look inside, feel what needs to be felt
There are choices you can make
The humble ones of the poet

The player
He cannot sleep at night
The player
Whose soul was killed in war
